            <p class="card-text">Lacie was a ball of energy as a puppy. As part of a highly intelligent breed, Lacie caught on very fast when it came to learning new tricks (as well as learning how to get her way!). She is extraordinarly sweet, loving, warm, affectionate, and cuddly. She will often jump onto her owner's lap or straight up into her owner's arms. Her affectionate and loving nature translates very well to being a caring, protective, and responsible mother to her pups. </p>

            <p>One of three red merles in Lacie's first litter, Pavo started off as the smaller one of the trio and ended up being one of the biggest pups come 7 weeks of age. This adorable guy with a big buddha belly is bound to be on the larger-end of the Mini Aussie size spectrum. He is a loving, playful, and energetic male who is waiting for the perfect home!  </p>

            <h2>Persius</h2>
            <p>On the spectrum of low energy to spastic, bounce-off-the-walls wild, our male red merle pup Persius appears to be in the lower-middle part of the range. He is a happy pup no doubt, though he keeps a bit more to himself and is somewhat more aloof. Nevertheless he's always willing to give puppy kisses and people always get his tail wagging. He has a warm heart and is a gentle soul. If you seek a more low-key version of a mini aussie, he may just be your guy!</p>

                <p>This little fellow has been lovingly called 'Mr Panda' by his breeders,given his more unique facial markings and color scheme resembling the famed asiatic creature. Much like the ever-elusive Pandas in Asia, Orion has a rare gaze that seems to look straight into your soul. This is a compliment, as it seems to suggest a deeper sentience or awareness than your typical puppy. No doubt a special little guy, Orion is warm and loving when approached and tends to do his own thing with his fellow pup companions otherwise. This one of a kind pup is just waiting to meet his perfect match!    </p>

            <p class="card-text">Louie was quite timid and aloof as a young puppy. It took him a while to break out of his shell--and largely thanks to Lacie's encouragement, he broke out with a bang! Louie can be quite the hyper boy, often jumping up in excitement upon seeing his adoring owners. He can also be quite calm and enjoys lounging around, as the mood strikes him. What is constant is his soft and gentle disposition, which tells one quite clearly that he wouldn't hurt a fly. This kind nature translated well in his fatherly duties to his puppies. He spent much time with the pups shortly after birth (when momma finally let him near!), teaching them how to play and engaging with them frequently.</p>
