# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Here will be included my projects related to HTML and CSS from my Tech Academy Bootcamp


- _[Bootstrap Website](https://github.com/developeralain/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/bootstrap4_project):_ created a simple single-page website using Boostrap4, focused on promoting a litter of puppies that our dog Lacie just had. The website allows users to see the available puppies and fill in a web form to contact us about purchasing a puppy.
- _[One Page Website](https://github.com/developeralain/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/One-Page%20Website):_ created a simple single-page website only using CSS and HTML. This website also focused on promoting a new litter of puppies that our dog, Lacie, just had.
