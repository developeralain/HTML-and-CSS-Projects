                <h2>About Frankenmuth Mini Aussies</h2>
                <p>Frankenmuth Mini Aussies is a breeding business 
                    originating in Frankenmuth, Michigan. It was created by Karistia Lipowicz in 2021.</p>
                <p>Karistia has been passionate about dogs for some time. Since she was a little girl she always had dogs in her life as they were regarded as an important part of the family.
                    She realized that she wanted to pursue her passion by breeding her favorite kind of dog : the Miniature Australian Shepherd (also known as 'American Shepherd'). 
                    Her adventure began in October 2021 when her dame, Lacie, conceived 7 gorgeous, happy and healthy puppies.</p>
                <p>Frankenmuth Mini Aussies offers a warm and loving environment for puppies to grow and develop into the best versions of themselves. We live in a safe community in a rural area with plenty of room to run around and play.
                    When considering one of our puppies you can be certain that they have been cared for very well, with love and ample attention, and that they will be happy and healthy if you decide to take one home with you.</p>
