        <p class="Matrix">In the Matrix there is no spoon. No sunny days. No prominent moon.
            In the matrix we frolick and dance. But only in our minds, as we wear no pants.
            </p>
        <p class="Reality">In reality it is naked that we lay. Motionless in the pods all day.
            But reality is grim - it isn't kind. So we serve the machines
        </p>
        <p class="Matrix">as The Matrix is sublime</p>
