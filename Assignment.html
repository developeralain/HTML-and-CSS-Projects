            <h3>You may enjoy synchronzied swimming, puppies enjoy 'synchronized pooping'</h3>
                <p>I have observed in my 5 weeks (thus far) of being a guardian to 7 lovely puppies that they seem to have some 'unspoken' 
                    level of communication amongst them that is perhaps below the level of their own awareness. This phenomenon I term a 
                    'mesh network'. Puppies demonstrate this phenomenon when defecating: one puppy 'initializes' this mesh activity which
                    then spurs all the other puppies into the same activity at roughly the same time : and voi la, you end up having all 
                    puppies defecating in unison. The same sort of 'mesh synchronicity' is observed when they urinate as well. 
                
                </p>
                <h6>What is the 'ether' of the 'Mesh Network'?</h6>
                <p>Clearly this is not a mere coincidence, as I've surmised in my earlier paragraph, but rather there must be some entity or
                    entities that are transmitted amongst the puppies that would trigger this chain reaction of elimination activities (pooping 
                    and peeing). I would hazard to say that it is likely a type of pheremone some such scent-based particle that is present in 
                    the eliminated matter that is then detected by adjacent puppies and so triggers the chain reaction.
